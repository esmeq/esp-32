ESP32 Mini Projects 🚀

This repository is a collection of mini projects developed using the ESP32.

The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey with the ESP32, starting from the very basics and progressing step by step toward more advanced and complete projects.

📌 What you’ll find here

Beginner-level ESP32 experiments

Small standalone projects to test specific features (GPIO, WiFi, Bluetooth, sensors, etc.)

Gradually more complex projects as my skills improve

Final and more structured projects at the end of the journey

Each project will be organized in its own folder and will include:

Source code

A short description of the project

Notes or comments about what I learned (when useful)

🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

A personal learning log

A place to track progress over time

A reference for future projects

A showcase of my growth working with embedded systems and the ESP32

🛠 Technologies

ESP32

Arduino / ESP-IDF (depending on the project)

C / C++

📈 Progress

Projects will be added incrementally, from simple examples to more complete and polished applications.
